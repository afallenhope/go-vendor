# [FKS] Go Vendor

You seen it in Java, C#, ExpressJS and now... Golang.


## Why?

I feel like there's so much opportunity in porting projects from one language to another.

 1. It's a great way to learn a new language.
 2. Benchmarking specs to see which is faster is always fun
 3. Why not?

Alright, probably not the best reasons but I figured I'd try it out.


## How do?

I've provided a `Makefile` so you can run tests, deploy and run.


## Commands?

`make test` - this runs the tests

`make run` - build and runs the application

`make build` - builds the application to bin/vendor

`make migration migrationname` - this creates a migration file.

`make migrate-up` - runs all the migrations **up**.sql

`make migrate-down` - runs all the migrations **down**.sql


## Bugs?

There is a possibility, please open a pull request.

I'll review the code and if it passes the smell test, I'll merge it.

If the code can be testable, please write a **test** for it.

# DISCLAIMER

This is not "production ready"

It's a hobby project for now, I may go over it again secure it more and more.
